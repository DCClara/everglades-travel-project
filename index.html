            <h4>Why the Everglades?</h4>
            <h2>The Everglades is the only subtropical preserve in the U.S.</h2>
            <p>
              The Florida Everglades is an intricate system of wetlands, lakes,
              and rivers, and it is this complexity that makes it so
              spectacular. Eight distinct habitats are found here, including
              hardwood hammocks, coastal lowlands, and marine waters. But the
              Everglades is best known for its mangroves, sawgrass prairies, and
              freshwater sloughs that draw water from Lake Okeechobee to the
              Florida Bay.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Everglades National Park is known for its abundant wildlife,
              with more than 360 bird species having been spotted within its
              boundaries. The park offers a wide range of animal species,
              including some that are endangered. Visitors can catch a glimpse
              of alligators, deer, manatees, dolphins, black bears, panthers,
              turtles, and many other creatures that make it a one-of-a-kind and
              captivating place for nature enthusiasts.

              Hi, I'm Danielle, a proud resident of South Florida. One of my
              main objectives is to bring attention to the different challenges
              that the Florida Everglades face, including environmental and
              cultural issues.
